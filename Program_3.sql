[15] /*SQL LIKE Operator*/

/*The SQL LIKE Operator
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
% - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
_ - The underscore represents a single character
Note: MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_).
The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!*/

/*LIKE Syntax*/
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
